SIGNTASK : SignTool warning : No file digest algorithm specified. Please specify the digest algorithm with the /fd flag. Using /fd SHA256 is recommended and considered more secure than SHA1. Calling signtool with /fd sha1 is equivalent to the previous behavior. In future releases, this parameter will be required. In order to select the hash algorithm used in the signing certificate's signature, use the /fd certHash option.
